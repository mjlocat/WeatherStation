# WeatherStation

This is my setup for pulling data from the Acurite 5-in-1 weather station.

The C code to interface with the weather station is copied from https://github.com/draythomp/Desert-Home-RPi and has no modifications (at this point).

The rest of the code has been implemented to suit my needs.
